Figma is a tool that allows designers to use our design system to create functional and usable designs for new projects, and to communicate in a visual way with developers and stakeholders.

Figma is not the primary source of truth for the design system. The primary source of truth is the code. Figma is a tool that allows designers to use our design system to create functional and usable designs for new projects, and to communicate in a visual way with developers and stakeholders. The code remains in github and figma uses this to create the design system that designers use.

Figma is a collaborative design tool that allows designers to create and share designs in a real-time collaborative environment.
